Instructions for Running Graph Functions:

  Compile GNode.Java, Node.java, GraphMethods.java, and GraphMethodsTester.java
  
  Run GraphMethodsTester; you can also make changes in GraphMethodsTester to create new Graphs to test
  
  All files are commented thoroughly, so figuring out where and how to add nodes and their children should be easy
  
  
Instructions for Running Word Counter:

  Compile WordCount.java
  
  Run WordCount and then input into the console the name of the text file you would like scanned
  
  *Make sure the text file is in the same folder that you are running the program from, or you will get a FileNotFoundException
